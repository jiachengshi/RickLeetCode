Completed No666, get 5ms calculation speed. Not that bad. The best solution is global variable and ptrs. I do not like them."

1. Data structure: Tree
2. Algorithm : DFS:
    I. Get rt value,
    II. a. if has leaves
        b. if no leaf
    III. Integrated sum

3. Need to think about route sum. Means we do not need to care about previous status. Do sum and add final leaves will be OK.
