1. Head means the 1st one. The address of head can point to any LinkNode.
2. Edge case:
    a. Size:0, 1, 2
3. Make head and tail always in their correct position. Because we may swap them with the number in the middle.
4. QuickSort is not good enough. I prefered to use mergeSort for this kind of questions.
5. Divide phase, Divide the problem into subproblems.
6. Conquer phase: Repeatedly solve each subproblem independently and combine the result to form the original problem
7. This problem involves two points:
    a. 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists //EASY
    b. 876. Middle of the Linked List //EASY
