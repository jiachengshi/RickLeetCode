This is a very simple problem. I used 10 minutes finished coding.
Mainly tips are creating a dummyheads. I created a new head for adding different node in that new List. May try to rewhirl the ListNode.
Approach 1 is using Recursion.
Approach 2 is rewhirling, it requires four ptr: prehead prev l1ptr l2ptr.
    - prehead : root of prehead
    - prev : which node was just relinked to prehead
    - l1ptr : which node in list1
    - l2ptr : which node in list2
