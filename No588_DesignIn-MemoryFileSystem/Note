This is a question about the FileSystem design. The difficulty of this problem should be medium.
It is hard to get idea but easy to understand.

LS algorithm: path.substr(path.find_last_of('/')+1)

FileSystem Data Structure:
struct Node{
    unordered_map< string, Node* > dir = {};
    vector<string> pathList = {};
    string content = "";
}

File system usually can be considered as Trie. The next level is the next layer in tree.

ls, mkdir, readContent, addContent
